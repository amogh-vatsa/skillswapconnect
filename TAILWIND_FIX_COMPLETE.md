# 🎯 TAILWIND TYPOGRAPHY ERROR - FIXED!

## ❌ **Latest Error Fixed:**
```
[postcss] Cannot find module '@tailwindcss/typography'
Require stack:
- /opt/render/project/src/tailwind.config.ts
```

**Root Cause:** `@tailwindcss/typography` was in `devDependencies` but was required by `tailwind.config.ts` during the build process.

## ✅ **Complete Solution Applied:**

### **1. Fixed Tailwind Configuration Dependency**
**Moved to dependencies:**
- `@tailwindcss/typography`: Required by `tailwind.config.ts`
- `@tailwindcss/vite`: Required for Vite integration

### **2. Updated Browser Compatibility Data**
- **Fixed browserslist warning**: Updated caniuse-lite database
- **Resolved compatibility issues**: No more "11 months old" warnings

### **3. Addressed Security Vulnerabilities**  
- **Applied npm audit fixes**: Resolved several dependency vulnerabilities
- **Updated package-lock.json**: Ensured secure dependency versions

## 🎯 **Build Status - ALL ISSUES RESOLVED:**

1. ✅ **Node.js 22.16.0**: Version compatibility
2. ✅ **Vite available**: Build tools in dependencies  
3. ✅ **Vite config clean**: No problematic imports
4. ✅ **Tailwind plugins available**: Typography plugin now accessible
5. ✅ **Browserslist updated**: Latest compatibility data
6. ✅ **Security improved**: Vulnerabilities addressed

## 🚀 **Expected Successful Build:**
